        During the 2015 London Fashion Week,<i> Topshop teamed up with Twitter and launched the <b>#LIVETRENDS</b> real-time campaign.</i> Based on the front row fashion Tweets, most in-trend styles were identified and the collections were accordingly made available in stores to let customers shop for those immediately, 
        informed by the real-time data collected by the brand. The content was put up seamlessly across Twitter, on their website, in the window of its flagship store and on digital billboards in key UK cities, within ten minutes’ walk of the nearest Topshop store by integrating trend data from Twitter with product data from Topshop’s systems. 
        <i>The result was a <b>75% increase in sales</b> of the featured products.</i>
