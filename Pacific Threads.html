	<h1>ABOUT US</h1> 
	<h2>Our Beginnings</h2> 
    Pacific Threads was founded September 2016 in Nanaimo, BC, on Vancouver Island. We are two prairie <b><u>escapees who met each other while attending the local university.</u></b> We both moved to British Columbia, 
    and fell in love with the culture of the west coast, and Vancouver Island in particular.<br>
    The island radiates peacefulness and beauty, with many unique places to explore.

    <h4>Community Matters</h4> 
    We are a community-focused company, and strive to actively support ours. Pacific <i>Threads proudly donates a portion of our profits to the Tillicum Lelum Aboriginal Friendship Centreâ€™s Nickels and Dimes for Nursery Rhymes campaign to build a new childcare centre in Nanaimo.</i><br> 
    Tillicum Lelum is devoted to making a positive change in the community through their vast array of services and active engagement within the community. 
    We are thrilled to be able to contribute, and after hearing some of the stories from their representative of how the work they do inspires change, we wanted to be a part of it and are proud to give what we can.
	<h4>Ethically-made Apparel</h4>
    Pacific Threads maintains a strong focus on community, part of that focus includes using socially responsible and environmentally conscious suppliers, ensuring safe working conditions and premium-quality apparel.<br> 
    <b>Pacific Threads is striving to use products sourced from Canada, and the U.S. with our main focus on using Canadian-made </b> 
    All our products are printed in Canada and many of our products are already made in Canada. Our goal is to source 90% of our products from Canada within the next 3 months.
